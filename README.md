# IglooToDo

My solution is a straightforward HTML/CSS/JavaScript site, as that's what I currently know. That's not exactly what you asked for so just acknowledging that straight away!

Items can be added, viewed, marked as 'done', and deleted.

State is maintained using local storage, so items and their 'done' status persist between page visits from the same browser.

I've kept the design simple, within modern design norms, utilising Igloo's pink colour and the closest font I could find on Google Fonts.
